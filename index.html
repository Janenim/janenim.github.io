      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
       I’m a recent graduate from the University of Central Arkansas, where I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems 
        with a Minor in Computer Science and Honors in Interdisciplinary Studies. During my time at UCA, I was honored to receive 
        the Presidential Medallion from President Houston and was named the Outstanding College of Business Student of the Year.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve gained hands-on technical experience as an Information Systems Intern at Acxiom, where I worked with IBM QRadar as the primary 
        SIEM tool to monitor, analyze, and respond to security threats affecting the company’s infrastructure. This role deepened my interest 
        in cybersecurity and strengthened my technical problem-solving skills.  I’m fluent in Mandarin and English. 
        During my time in UCA, I’ve been actively involved in planning and hosting campus events that promote diversity, support international students, and foster a sense of belonging. As an 
        international student, I’ve learned to adapt quickly to new cultures and environments. Flexibility, open-mindedness, and resilience 
        are core strengths I bring to both personal and professional settings. I’m naturally curious, love solving complex problems, and am 
        always eager to grow through new challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I love reading books and watching movies, especially genres like crime or mystery! It's a great way for me 
        to unwind and stay inspired by clever storytelling and puzzle-like plots.
       </p>
